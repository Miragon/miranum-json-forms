## About The Project

Miranum IDE is a collection of "VS Code Plugins" that allows you to edit, manage and access all artifacts for your 
process application in one place.
Please find our official docs [here](https://miranum.com/docs/components/miranum-ide/intro-miranum-ide).

> **_NOTE:_** At some point in the future, this repository will be migrated to our [official repository](https://github.com/FlowSquad/miranum-ide).

### Built With

The documentation project is built with technologies we use in our projects:

* [Backoffice-Plus Formbuilder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backoffice-plus/formbuilder)
* [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Features

> **_NOTE:_** Currently, both the `schema` and the `uischema` are stored in one file. However, the default is to use 
> two separate files. We are working on supporting this in the future.

* Create and edit `.form.json` files
* Open a preview to display your form
* Use the vscode standard text editor to apply changes
